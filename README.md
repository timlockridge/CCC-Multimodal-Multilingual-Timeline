CCC-Multimodal-Multilingual-Timeline
=====================================

A working version of this timeline is viewable at [timlockridge.com/timeline](http://www.timlockridge.com/timeline/)

It is part of larger collaborative project with Bruce Horner and Cindy Selfe. The timeline maps the use of two keywords--"multilingual" and "multimodal"--in CCC. The timeline is built with [timelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/), with just a few minor changes to the javascript & css.

The dataset, located in cccc.json, might be helpful for additional projects. We're releasing the source and hoping that others can extend the dataset.
